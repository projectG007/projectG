      <h1>Still Us</h1>
<p>
  I don’t know when it happened —<br>
  but somewhere between all the laughs, late-night talks, and quiet moments…<br>
  you became home.
</p>
<p>
  Loving you feels effortless,<br>
  like my heart just knows where it belongs.
</p>
<p>
  No big words, no promises wrapped in gold —<br>
  just you and me,<br>
  choosing each other every day.
</p>
<p><strong>Happy Anniversary, my love.</strong><br>
Here's to everything we are, and everything we’ll become.</p>
