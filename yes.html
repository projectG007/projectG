      <h1>I don’t know when it happened —
but somewhere between all the laughs, late-night talks, and quiet moments…
you became home.

Loving you feels effortless,
like my heart just knows where it belongs.

No big words, no promises wrapped in gold —
just you and me,
choosing each other every day.

Happy Anniversary, my love.
Here's to everything we are, and everything we’ll become.</h1>
