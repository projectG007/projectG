      <p>
        I don’t know when it happened —<br>
        but somewhere between all the laughs, late-night talks,<br>
        and quiet moments… <b>you became home.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you feels effortless,<br>
        like my heart just knows where it belongs.
      </p>

      <p>
        No big words, no promises wrapped in gold —<br>
        just <b>you and me</b>,<br>
        choosing each other every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Happy Anniversary, my love.</b><br>
        Here’s to everything we are,<br>
        and everything we’ll become.
